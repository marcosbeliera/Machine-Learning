## Predictive Modeling for Customer Retention in the Banking Sector

### Problem and General Objective

This dataset is originally found on the website https://leaps.analyttica.com/home, but it was obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/sakshigoyal7/credit-card-customers.

The manager of one of the branches of the bank to which the data science department belongs is concerned because an increasing number of customers are leaving their credit card services. It would be greatly appreciated if it were possible to predict proactively which customers should be approached to provide them with better services and change their decisions in the opposite direction. The dataset consists of 10,000 customers who mention their age, salary, marital status, credit card limit, credit card category, among other variables. Only 16.07% of customers who have left the service are available, so several transformations will need to be made to the imbalanced dataset.

### Specific objectives:

- Identify behaviors and characteristics of individuals who tend to leave or stay with the bank's service
- Generate a model that can predict whether a customer will leave or stay with the offered service
- Propose short and long-term actions that can better retain customers who are leaving based on the obtained information
